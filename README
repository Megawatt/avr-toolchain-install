AVR TOOLCHAIN
-------------

This script fetches AVR toolchain (Atmel) sources 
and builds the toolchain. The versions are defined in the 
beginning of the script. The ones used here are more recent
than the ones usually included in packages.

Links to the projects:

binutils: http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
gcc:      http://gcc.gnu.org/
avr-libc: http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avr-libc/

The toolchain is installed in 'install' directory under the directory
where the script is started. It can be moved elsewhere without problems.

To use the toolchain, PATH needs to include the /bin directory of the 
toolchain. E.g.
PATH=$PATH:/<install directory>/bin
 
When running the script, make sure it is executable.

chmod a+x install-avr-toolchain
./install-avr-toolchain
